    "essay": "The Florida Everglades teem with life. Situated at the southern end of the state, between Lake Okeechobee and the Gulf Coast, the Everglades are the largest wilderness east of the Mississippi River. Migratory and wading birds tiptoe through marshy grasslands. Orchids and ferns dot the hardwood forests. Alligators lounge in the shallows and on muddy riverbanks. Mangrove leaves rustle in the wind as the brackish water laps at their roots.The Florida Everglades once covered 11,000 acres across the southern end of the state. Wetlands are an important ecosystem. For centuries, however, humans thought of wetlands as unhygienic swamps. Draining the Everglades was suggested in the late 19th century. As soon as Florida became a state in 1845, its legislature asked permission from Congress to drain the Everglades. Canals were dug to remove or redirect the water. Land that dried out was reclaimed for agriculture or building purposes. This reclamation allowed for significant development in south Florida. Sugar farmers moved into the area and prospered. The city of Miami took root. Approximately 50% of the Everglades has been reclaimed for agricultural or urban use. Much of the northern area has been polluted with phosphorus. This phosphorus is agricultural runoff from the farms near the Everglades. Concerned Floridians had been advocating for saving the area since the 1930s. Their efforts paid off in 1947 when Congress created the Everglades National Park. Starting in the late 1970s environmental concerns at both the national and international levels refocused attention on the Everglades. The area was designated as one of the world’s most important wetland areas. Since then, efforts have been underway to safeguard the park and return the Everglades to health. Water levels are monitored, as are nutrient levels in both water and soil samples. This has been the largest environmental conservation project in the history of the United States. Much of it is designed to reverse-engineer the canal system that was built in the 19th and mid-20th centuries. Ecological indicators are showing some improvements. The crayfish population is up. Wading and migratory birds have improved their nesting habits. Despite all the good news, the Everglades now face a new threat. In the United States the Burmese python is a popular pet. Docile and beautifully patterned in brown and gold diamond shapes, these snakes can be purchased at pet stores or reptile shows. Owners keep them in cages or tanks and feed them rats or mice. Most people buy pythons when the animals are small. Pythons can grow very quickly. For many pet owners, the pet pythons become too big to manage. The first Burmese python was found in the Florida Everglades in 1979. It’s presumed the animal was originally kept as a pet and then released by its owner. Starting in 1992—when it’s thought that numerous Burmese pythons escaped pet stores and cages damaged in Hurricane Andrew—the numbers have grown at a faster rate. The Burmese pythons that have been released in southern Florida have found a habitat they like in the Everglades. They are breeding in the Everglades and have reached numbers that designate them as an invasive species. Pythons are eating machines. They can eat anything from deer to bobcats, to raccoons to alligators. They especially enjoy dining on small mammals and birds. Studies have shown that since their appearance in the Everglades, the numbers of small mammals in the area are down significantly. Additionally, this population loss is not observed in areas where the python has not established itself. In 2013 the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation program issued permits to hunt the snakes within state wildlifemanaged areas of the Everglades. Sixty-eight animals were captured.  ",

    "essay": "More than crickets and fireflies, more than baseball and cookouts, perhaps nothing signals the arrival of summer in the United States like the soft familiar whir of air-conditioning. But there is growing concern that as other countries adopt America’s love of air-conditioners, the electricity used to power them will overburden electrical grids and increase planet-warming emissions.The number of air-conditioners worldwide is predicted to soar from 1.6 billion units today to 5.6 billion units by midcentury, according to a report issued Tuesday by the International Energy Agency. If left unchecked, by 2050 air-conditioners would use as much electricity as China does for all activities today.Greenhouse gas emissions released by coal and natural gas plants when generating electricity to power those air-conditioners would nearly double, from 1.25 billion tons in 2016 to 2.28 billion tons in 2050, the report says. Those emissions would contribute to global warming, which could further heighten the demand for air\ufffeconditioning.Right now air-conditioning is concentrated in a handful of countries, mainly in the United States and Japan, and increasingly in China.While 90 percent of American households have air-conditioning, “When we look in fact at the hot countries in the world, in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, where about 2.8 billion people live, only about 8 percent of the population owns an air\ufffeconditioner,” said Fatih Birol, executive director of the energy agency.As incomes in those countries rise, however, more people are installing air-conditioners in their homes. The energy agency predicts much of the growth in air-conditioning will occur in India, China and Indonesia.Some of the spread is simply being driven by a desire for comfort in parts of the world that have always been hot. But other factors are at play.For example, as household wealth increases, so does the presence of household appliances like refrigerators and televisions, the report notes. These appliances generate heat, making homes warmer.“The World Wants Airconditioning.That Could Warm the World.”And because air-conditioners work in part by venting hot air outside, they also make the surrounding neighborhood warmer. By some estimates air-conditioning can raise overnight temperatures by about two degrees Fahrenheit (one degree Celsius) in some cities, the report said. Practically speaking, if enough of your neighbors buy an air-conditioner it may increase the temperature in your home enough to drive you to do the same.And then, of course, there’s climate change. India is already one degree Fahrenheit warmer on average than it was a century ago. This has led to more “cooling degree days,” or days when average temperatures are warm enough to necessitate air-conditioning.“If you look at cooling degree days for Chennai or Mumbai, these are places that have twice as many cooling degree days as the hottest city in the U.S., Miami,” said Lucas Davis, director of the Energy Institute at the Haas School of Business of the University of California, Berkeley. “It’s unbelievably hot — there’s nothing in the U.S. that compares in terms of heat to these cities in India.”And when it gets hot, forgoing air-conditioning can be deadly. The heat wave that plagued Chicago in 1995 killed more than 700 people, while the 2003 European heat wave and 2010 Russian heat wave killed tens of thousands each. Researchers have found that climate change made the European heat wave deadlier and the Russian heat wave more likely.The introduction of home air-conditioning in the United States has cut premature deaths on hot days by 75 percent since 1960, another study has shown. That is why both Dr. Davis and Dr. Birol say the solution lies not in convincing countries to forgo air-conditioners, but in making air-conditioning more energy efficient. That could cut by half the additional energy demand for cooling in the coming years.Many air-conditioners on sale in India today use twice as much electricity to provide the same amount of cooling as more efficient units, Dr. Davis said.On the other end of the spectrum, air-conditioners sold in Japan and the European Union tend to be 25 percent more efficient than units sold in the United States and China.

    "essay": "One of four sacred mountains, it marks the southern boundary of the traditional homeland of the Navajo tribe. The summit is a holy site of prayer and ceremonies. Medicine men gather herbs and soil on the slopes. For centuries, Mount Taylor has been a sacred place for Native American tribes in the Southwest. Today, it is a place in peril. Mount Taylor, at an elevation of 11,300 feet, is visible from more than 100 miles away. Douglas fir, aspen, and piñon pine trees in the Cibola National Forest blanket the mountain. Spires of volcanic rock rise on the north slope. The peak is often snow-capped. But it is what lies underneath the mountain that threatens this site. Mount Taylor sits atop one of the richest uranium ore reserves in the country. Uranium is a metal found in the layers of sandstone in the Four Corners area of New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Utah. The city of Grants, New Mexico, 20 miles from Mount Taylor, was once considered a uranium capital of the world. This element is radioactive. Its atoms can easily be made to release huge amounts of energy. A single pound of uranium contains about as much energy as 3  million pounds of coal. In nuclear power plants, uranium rods are used as fuel to produce energy.Extracting the ore is a long and complicated process. For every two pounds of uranium, 998 pounds of radioactive waste is left over in piles and pits. Over time it can leak into the soil and underground water if the area is not reclaimed. Uranium mining in New Mexico was a booming business from the 1950s to 1980s, but it took its toll on the people and the land. Exposure to radioactive dust andcontaminated groundwater causes health problems. Indeed, there is a higher incidence of lung cancer and other serious illnesses in mining communities. Rocks tinged with the greenish hue of uranium ore blanket the landscape because cleanup of old mining activity has not been completed. Mines on Mount Taylor were shuttered in 1990 due to the low price of uranium. Recently Canadian, Japanese, and U.S. companies have submitted permits to establish new mines even though current U.S. mines are operating at only one third of their capacity.  The nearby city of Grants welcomes the opportunity to provide jobs and create business projects. Millions of dollars of tax revenues would benefit the entire state. But U.S. Forest Service officials acknowledge that the mines will have significant impact on archaeological sites and traditional Native activities. Mining may contaminate the water source for nearby Acoma Sky City, the oldest inhabited community in the United States. But an 1872federal law permits mining regardless of its impact on cultural or natural resources. In 2009, members of the Navajo Nation, Hopi tribe, and Zuni, Acoma, and Laguna Pueblos worked together with the state of New Mexico to obtain the special designation as a Traditional Cultural Property for 434,000 acres of Mount Taylor. The Native Americans felt this was the best way to protect their sacred mountain while still providing the public with access for wood gathering, hunting, hiking, and cattle grazing. This special status for Mount .  Taylor angered the mining companies, ranchers, and property owners, whose livelihoods depend on using this land. Court battles challenged the status with claims that the area was too large to be protected as a historic site. A state district court overturned the Traditional Cultural Property designation in 2011. The case is now in the state Supreme Court.Mount Taylor was named one of America’s Most Endangered Places by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Uranium mining is the turning point. ",

    "essay": "I fell in love with the minister's son the winter I turned fourteen. He was not Chinese, but as white as Mary in the  manger. For Christmas I prayed for this blond-haired boy,  Robert, and a slim new American nose. When I found out that my parents had invited the minister's  family over for Christmas Eve dinner, I cried. What would  Robert think of our shabby Chinese Christmas? What would he think of our noisy Chinese relatives who lacked  proper American manners? What terrible disappointment  would he feel upon seeing not a roasted turkey and sweet  potatoes but Chinese food? On Christmas Eve I saw that my mother had outdone  herself in creating a strange menu. She was pulling black  veins out of the backs of fleshy prawns. The kitchen was littered with appalling mounds of raw food: A slimy rock  cod with bulging eyes that pleaded not to be thrown into a  pan of hot oil. Tofu, which looked like stacked wedges of  rubbery white sponges. A bowl soaking dried fungus back  to life. A plate of squid, their backs crisscrossed with knife  markings so they resembled bicycle tires. And then they arrived – the minister's family and all my  relatives in a clamor of doorbells and rumpled Christmas packages. Robert grunted hello, and I  pretended he was not worthy of existence. Dinner threw me deeper into despair. My relatives  licked the ends of their chopsticks and reached across  the table, dipping them into the dozen or so plates of  food. Robert and his family waited patiently for platters to be passed to them. My relatives murmured with  pleasure when my mother brought out the whole  steamed fish. Robert grimaced. Then my father poked  his chopsticks just below the fish eye and plucked out  the soft meat. Amy, your favorite, he said, offering me  the tender fish cheek. I wanted to disappear. At the end of the meal my father leaned back and  belched loudly, thanking my mother for her fine cooking. It's a polite Chinese custom to show you are  satisfied, explained my father to our astonished guests.  Robert was looking down at his plate with a reddened  face. The minister managed to muster up a quiet burp. I  was stunned into silence for the rest of the night. After everyone had gone, my mother said to me, You  want to be the same as American girls on the outside. She handed me an early gift. It was a miniskirt in beige tweed. But inside you must always be Chinese. You must be proud you are different. Your only shame  is to have shame. And even though I didn't agree with her then, I knew that she understood how much I had suffered during the evening's dinner. It wasn't until many years later – long  after I had gotten over my crush on Robert – that I was able to fully appreciate her lesson and the true purpose behind our particular menu. For Christmas Eve that year, she had chosen all my favorite foods.",
