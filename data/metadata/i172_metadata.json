    "essay":"The Florida Everglades teem with life. Situated at the southern end of the state, between Lake Okeechobee and the Gulf Coast, the Everglades are the largest wilderness east of the Mississippi River. Migratory and wading birds tiptoe through marshy grasslands. Orchids and ferns dot the hardwood forests. Alligators lounge in the shallows and on muddy riverbanks. Mangrove leaves rustle in the wind as the brackish water laps at their roots.The Florida Everglades once covered 11,000 acres across the southern end of the state. Wetlands are an important ecosystem. For centuries, however, humans thought of wetlands as unhygienic swamps. Draining the Everglades was suggested in the late 19th century. As soon as Florida became a state in 1845, its legislature asked permission from Congress to drain the Everglades. Canals were dug to remove or redirect the water. Land that dried out was reclaimed for agriculture or building purposes. This reclamation allowed for significant development in south Florida. Sugar farmers moved into the area and prospered. The city of Miami took root. Approximately 50% of the Everglades has been reclaimed for agricultural or urban use. Much of the northern area has been polluted with phosphorus. This phosphorus is agricultural runoff from the farms near the Everglades. Concerned Floridians had been advocating for saving the area since the 1930s. Their efforts paid off in 1947 when Congress created the Everglades National Park. Starting in the late 1970s environmental concerns at both the national and international levels refocused attention on the Everglades. The area was designated as one of the world’s most important wetland areas. Since then, efforts have been underway to safeguard the park and return the Everglades to health. Water levels are monitored, as are nutrient levels in both water and soil samples. This has been the largest environmental conservation project in the history of the United States. Much of it is designed to reverse-engineer the canal system that was built in the 19th and mid-20th centuries. Ecological indicators are showing some improvements. The crayfish population is up. Wading and migratory birds have improved their nesting habits. Despite all the good news, the Everglades now face a new threat. In the United States the Burmese python is a popular pet. Docile and beautifully patterned in brown and gold diamond shapes, these snakes can be purchased at pet stores or reptile shows. Owners keep them in cages or tanks and feed them rats or mice. Most people buy pythons when the animals are small. Pythons can grow very quickly. For many pet owners, the pet pythons become too big to manage. The first Burmese python was found in the Florida Everglades in 1979. It’s presumed the animal was originally kept as a pet and then released by its owner. Starting in 1992—when it’s thought that numerous Burmese pythons escaped pet stores and cages damaged in Hurricane Andrew—the numbers have grown at a faster rate. The Burmese pythons that have been released in southern Florida have found a habitat they like in the Everglades. They are breeding in the Everglades and have reached numbers that designate them as an invasive species. Pythons are eating machines. They can eat anything from deer to bobcats, to raccoons to alligators. They especially enjoy dining on small mammals and birds. Studies have shown that since their appearance in the Everglades, the numbers of small mammals in the area are down significantly. Additionally, this population loss is not observed in areas where the python has not established itself. In 2013 the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation program issued permits to hunt the snakes within state wildlifemanaged areas of the Everglades. Sixty-eight animals were captured.  ",
