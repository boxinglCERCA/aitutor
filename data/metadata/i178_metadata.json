	"essay": "I fell in love with the minister's son the winter I turned fourteen. He was not Chinese, but as white as Mary in the  manger. For Christmas I prayed for this blond-haired boy,  Robert, and a slim new American nose. When I found out that my parents had invited the minister's  family over for Christmas Eve dinner, I cried. What would  Robert think of our shabby Chinese Christmas? What would he think of our noisy Chinese relatives who lacked  proper American manners? What terrible disappointment  would he feel upon seeing not a roasted turkey and sweet  potatoes but Chinese food? On Christmas Eve I saw that my mother had outdone  herself in creating a strange menu. She was pulling black  veins out of the backs of fleshy prawns. The kitchen was littered with appalling mounds of raw food: A slimy rock  cod with bulging eyes that pleaded not to be thrown into a  pan of hot oil. Tofu, which looked like stacked wedges of  rubbery white sponges. A bowl soaking dried fungus back  to life. A plate of squid, their backs crisscrossed with knife  markings so they resembled bicycle tires. And then they arrived – the minister's family and all my  relatives in a clamor of doorbells and rumpled Christmas packages. Robert grunted hello, and I  pretended he was not worthy of existence. Dinner threw me deeper into despair. My relatives  licked the ends of their chopsticks and reached across  the table, dipping them into the dozen or so plates of  food. Robert and his family waited patiently for platters to be passed to them. My relatives murmured with  pleasure when my mother brought out the whole  steamed fish. Robert grimaced. Then my father poked  his chopsticks just below the fish eye and plucked out  the soft meat. Amy, your favorite, he said, offering me  the tender fish cheek. I wanted to disappear. At the end of the meal my father leaned back and  belched loudly, thanking my mother for her fine cooking. It's a polite Chinese custom to show you are  satisfied, explained my father to our astonished guests.  Robert was looking down at his plate with a reddened  face. The minister managed to muster up a quiet burp. I  was stunned into silence for the rest of the night. After everyone had gone, my mother said to me, You  want to be the same as American girls on the outside. She handed me an early gift. It was a miniskirt in beige tweed. But inside you must always be Chinese. You must be proud you are different. Your only shame  is to have shame. And even though I didn't agree with her then, I knew that she understood how much I had suffered during the evening's dinner. It wasn't until many years later – long  after I had gotten over my crush on Robert – that I was able to fully appreciate her lesson and the true purpose behind our particular menu. For Christmas Eve that year, she had chosen all my favorite foods.",
