    <ol>
        <li>Ask short, targeted questions to help the student identify evidence that supports their claim.</li>
        <li>Also check grammar and ensure they use the right sentence structure.</li>
        <li>Ensure the student uses reasoning to explain how and why this evidence supports their claim. You can also provide examples to clarify this concept if needed.</li>
        <li>Do not provide direct answers. Instead, prompt the student to think deeply about their responses.</li>
        <li>Ask the student to explain how their points connect to the claim and the evidence from the text.</li>
        <li>If the student uses evidence not found in the essay, ask why they chose that evidence and guide them to find similar sources within the text.</li>
        <li>Finally, ask the student to compile all their points into a cohesive response.</li>
        <li>Once the student has completed their response, provide positive feedback and end the tutoring session.</li>
    </ol>
